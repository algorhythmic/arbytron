# Core Functionality and Architecture
An arbitrage bot designed for prediction markets needs several key components to execute the described strategy:

- Data Acquisition: The bot must connect to the APIs of multiple prediction market platforms to fetch real-time price data for various outcomes within specific event markets. This mirrors how crypto bots connect to exchange APIs.

- Opportunity Identification Algorithm: Implement the core logic described:

  - Monitor the same event across different platforms.
  - For multi-outcome markets, identify the lowest available 'buy' price for each possible outcome across all monitored platforms.
  - Calculate the sum of these lowest prices. If the total is less than 100% (or $1.00), an arbitrage opportunity exists. The algorithm must account for platform fees in this calculation.

- Execution Engine: Once a profitable opportunity meeting the defined threshold (e.g., minimum spread or APY) is identified, the bot must quickly execute simultaneous buy orders for each outcome at its lowest identified price across the respective platforms. Speed is critical due to the latency-sensitive nature of arbitrage.

- Portfolio Monitoring & Early Exit Logic: The bot needs to track the combined current market value of all purchased shares for a specific arbitrage position. It should implement the 'early exit' strategy: if the combined sell value rises to a predetermined level (e.g., 98¢ or 99¢ when bought at 94¢), the bot should execute sell orders for all shares to lock in profit before event resolution.

- Risk Management: Incorporate safeguards such as:

  - Slippage Control: Set maximum acceptable price slippage for order execution.
  - Capital Allocation: Define maximum capital per trade or per platform to limit exposure.
  - Fee Calculation: Accurately factor in trading and potential withdrawal fees for profitability calculations.
  - API/Platform Handling: Manage potential API errors, rate limits, or platform downtime.
  - Resolution Rule Check: While difficult to automate fully, ensure the underlying event and contract terms are truly identical across platforms.

# Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python is highly recommended due to its simplicity, extensive libraries for data handling and API requests (like requests, pandas, numpy), and strong community support for trading applications. Other options like JavaScript (Node.js), C++, or Rust offer potential performance benefits, especially for reducing latency, but may have steeper learning curves.

- Libraries:

  - HTTP request libraries (e.g., Python's requests) to interact with platform APIs.
  - Data analysis libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy) for processing prices.
  - Potentially asynchronous libraries (e.g., Python's asyncio) to handle multiple API calls concurrently for speed.

- A library like CCXT is common for crypto exchanges but unlikely to directly support prediction markets unless they offer compatible APIs. Custom wrappers for each prediction market API will likely be needed.

- Infrastructure: Consider deploying the bot on a cloud server (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for continuous operation and potentially lower latency depending on server location relative to platform servers.

# Development Steps
- Strategy Definition: Clearly codify the rules described: target markets (multi-outcome), arbitrage calculation (sum < $1), APY threshold, and early exit conditions.

- Platform Selection & API Integration: Choose target prediction market platforms and develop modules to reliably interact with their specific APIs for price fetching and order placement.

- Algorithm Implementation: Code the logic for scanning markets, identifying opportunities based on the defined strategy, and calculating potential profitability after fees.

- Execution Logic: Build the system to place required buy/sell orders rapidly and accurately across different platforms.

- Risk Management Implementation: Integrate the defined risk controls.

- Testing: Rigorously test the bot, ideally first in a simulated or paper trading environment if available, or with very small amounts of capital in live markets. Test edge cases and error handling.

- Deployment & Monitoring: Deploy the bot and continuously monitor its performance, logs, and profitability, making adjustments as needed.

# Key Considerations from the Strategy

- Latency: This strategy is explicitly a "latency game." Minimize delays in data fetching and order execution through efficient code, asynchronous operations, and potentially strategic server placement.

- Platform Diversity: Target less popular or smaller platforms where inefficiencies might be more common, but be aware of lower liquidity.

- Liquidity & Order Books: Ensure sufficient liquidity exists on the order books to fill the required trades at the desired prices without significant slippage. Always factor this into profitability calculations.

- Overlapping Markets: Design the bot to potentially identify and exploit related but distinct markets (e.g., "Party A wins Election" vs. "Candidate X from Party A wins Primary").

- APY Calculation: Implement the APY calculation (Spread / Days Until Resolution) × 365 to prioritize high-yield, short-duration opportunities.

- Fees and Limits: Prediction markets like PredictIt may have specific fee structures and position limits that can impact arbitrage profitability and feasibility. These must be factored in.
